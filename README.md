# Block-Switch/Square Swap

Square Swap (formerly Block-Switch) is an unfinished mobile game I was working on.

I doubt I will ever finish it because of **scope-issues** (what I mean by that becomes apparent when you look at the **level editor** and the effort put into that).
The gameplay is very simple and it's nothing special so the level editor is the most interesting part about this project.
